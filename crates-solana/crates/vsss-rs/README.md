This crate provides various cryptography verifiable secret sharing schemes when the rust standard library is available.

* **This implementation has not been reviewed or audited. Use at your own risk.**
* This implementation targets Rust `1.65` or later.
* This implementation does not require the Rust standard library.
* All operations are constant time unless explicitly noted.

## NOTE if upgrading from Version 2

The interfaces have been redesigned to be compatible with each other as well as serialization.

Version 3 defines a set of traits for implementing secret sharing schemes. While the standard mode provides quick
and easy methods to split and combine secrets, the traits allow for more flexibility and customization especially in
no-std mode. Previous versions tried to keep the two modes aligned but in doing so resulted in a lot of code duplication
and stack overflow issues. The new traits allow for a single implementation to be used in both modes and allow
no-std consumers to use exactly what they need while minimizing code duplication and stack overflows.

## Components

All component traits are implemented for static arrays `[T; N]` and `GenericArray<T, N>` from 2-64 and `Vec<T>` by default.
Any higher, and its time to use an allocator or the stack might be overrun.

### Shares and Identifiers

There was lots of requests to enable share identifiers to be more than just `u8` values. This is now possible
by implementing the `ShareIdentifier` trait. The `ShareIdentifier` trait is a simple trait that provides the necessary
methods for splitting and combining shares. The `ShareIdentifier` trait is implemented for `u8` values by default.
Other values can be used by implementing the trait for the desired type but keep in might endianness.

`Share` is now a trait so shares can be implemented however consumers need them to be.

### Polynomials
`Polynomial` holds the coefficients of the polynomial and provides methods to evaluate the polynomial at a given point.
Polymomials are only used when splitting secrets.

### Share Sets
A share set is a collection of shares that belong to the same secret. The share set provides methods to combine into
the original secret or another group. These are offered as `ReadableShareSet` and `WriteableShareSet`. In no-std mode,
combines require a `ShareSetCombiner`.

`ShareSetCombiner` is the data store used during a secret reconstruct operation.

### Secret Sharing Schemes

Secret sharing schemes are implemented as traits. The traits provide methods to split secrets and if applicable return the 
verifier set. `Shamir` only splits secrets. `Feldman` returns a verifier set. `Pedersen` returns multiple verifier sets:
one for itself and one for `Feldman`.

`FeldmanVerifierSet` and `PedersenVerifierSet` are the verifier sets returned by the schemes. They provide methods to
validate the shares. 

Since `Pedersen` returns a large amount of information after a split the `PedersenResult` trait is used to encapsulate
the data. `StdPedersenResult` is provided when an allocator is available by default.

### Other noteworthy items

When operating in standard mode, no traits should be necessary to be implemented and there are default functions
to accomplish what you want just like in previous versions.

`StdVsss` provides the majority of methods needed to accomplish splitting and reconstructing secrets.

If you need custom structs in no-std mode the `vsss_arr_impl` macro will create the necessary implementations for you.

## [Documentation](https://docs.rs/vsss-rs)

Verifiable Secret Sharing Schemes are using to split secrets into
multiple shares and distribute them among different entities,
with the ability to verify if the shares are correct and belong
to a specific set. This crate includes Shamir's secret sharing
scheme which does not support verification but is more of a
building block for the other schemes.

This crate supports Feldman and Pedersen verifiable secret sharing
schemes.

Feldman and Pedersen are similar in many ways. It's hard to describe when to use
one over the other. Indeed both are used in [distributed key generation](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.134.6445&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

Feldman reveals the public value of the verifier whereas Pedersen's hides it.

Feldman and Pedersen are different from Shamir when splitting the secret.
Combining shares back into the original secret is identical across all methods
and is available for each scheme for convenience.

This crate is no-std compliant and uses const generics to specify sizes.

Shares are represented as byte arrays by default but can be changed by implementing the provided traits.
When specifying share sizes, use the field size in bytes + 1 for the identifier.
Shares can represent finite fields or groups
depending on the use case. The first byte is reserved for the share identifier (x-coordinate)
and everything else is the actual value of the share (y-coordinate).

## Default methods

The default methods for splitting and combining secrets are:

- shamir::split_secret
- feldman::split_secret
- pedersen::split_secret
- combine_shares
- combine_shares_group

### P-256

To split a p256 secret using Shamir

```rust
use vsss_rs::{*, shamir};
use elliptic_curve::ff::PrimeField;
use p256::{NonZeroScalar, Scalar, SecretKey};

let mut osrng = rand_core::OsRng::default();
let sk = SecretKey::random(&mut osrng);
let nzs = sk.to_nonzero_scalar();
let res = shamir::split_secret::<Scalar, u8, Vec<u8>>(2, 3, *nzs.as_ref(), &mut osrng);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let shares = res.unwrap();
let res = combine_shares(&shares);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let scalar: Scalar = res.unwrap();
let nzs_dup =  NonZeroScalar::from_repr(scalar.to_repr()).unwrap();
let sk_dup = SecretKey::from(nzs_dup);
assert_eq!(sk_dup.to_bytes(), sk.to_bytes());
```

### Secp256k1

To split a k256 secret using Shamir

```rust
use vsss_rs::{*, shamir};
use elliptic_curve::ff::PrimeField;
use k256::{NonZeroScalar, Scalar, ProjectivePoint, SecretKey};

let mut osrng = rand_core::OsRng::default();
let sk = SecretKey::random(&mut osrng);
let secret = *sk.to_nonzero_scalar();
let res = shamir::split_secret::<Scalar, u8, Vec<u8>>(2, 3, secret, &mut osrng);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let shares = res.unwrap();
let res = combine_shares(&shares);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let scalar: Scalar = res.unwrap();
let nzs_dup = NonZeroScalar::from_repr(scalar.to_repr()).unwrap();
let sk_dup = SecretKey::from(nzs_dup);
assert_eq!(sk_dup.to_bytes(), sk.to_bytes());
```
or to use feldman
```rust
use vsss_rs::{*, feldman};
use bls12_381_plus::{Scalar, G1Projective};
use elliptic_curve::ff::Field;

let mut rng = rand_core::OsRng::default();
let secret = Scalar::random(&mut rng);
let res = feldman::split_secret::<G1Projective, u8, Vec<u8>>(2, 3, secret, None, &mut rng);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let (shares, verifier) = res.unwrap();
for s in &shares {
    assert!(verifier.verify_share(s).is_ok());
}
let res = combine_shares(&shares);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let secret_1: Scalar = res.unwrap();
assert_eq!(secret, secret_1);
```

### Curve25519

Curve25519 is not a prime field but this crate does support it using
`features=["curve25519"]` which is enabled by default. This feature
wraps curve25519-dalek libraries so they can be used with Shamir, Feldman, and Pedersen.

Here's an example of using Ed25519 and x25519

```rust
use curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar;
use rand::Rng;
use ed25519_dalek::SecretKey;
use vsss_rs::{curve25519::WrappedScalar, *};
use x25519_dalek::StaticSecret;

let mut osrng = rand::rngs::OsRng::default();
let sc = Scalar::hash_from_bytes::<sha2_9::Sha512>(&osrng.gen::<[u8; 32]>());
let sk1 = StaticSecret::from(sc.to_bytes());
let ske1 = SecretKey::from_bytes(&sc.to_bytes()).unwrap();
let res = shamir::split_secret::<WrappedScalar, u8, Vec<u8>>(2, 3, sc.into(), &mut osrng);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let shares = res.unwrap();
let res = combine_shares(&shares);
assert!(res.is_ok());
let scalar: WrappedScalar = res.unwrap();
assert_eq!(scalar.0, sc);
let sk2 = StaticSecret::from(scalar.0.to_bytes());
let ske2 = SecretKey::from_bytes(&scalar.0.to_bytes()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(sk2.to_bytes(), sk1.to_bytes());
assert_eq!(ske1.to_bytes(), ske2.to_bytes());
```

Either `RistrettoPoint` or `EdwardsPoint` may be used when using Feldman and Pedersen VSSS.

## Testing

Due to no_std mode, this requires a larger stack than the current default.
